# this approach used below to determine ```version``` was inspired by

#
# why this complexity? wanted version number to be available in the
# a runtime.
#
# the code below assumes the distribution is being built with the
# current directory being the directory in which setup.py is stored
# which should be totally fine 99.9% of the time. not going to add
# the coode complexity to deal with other scenarios
